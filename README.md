# NSO-Task-CVE-Hunter
A project dependencies CVE finder. The purpose of this program is to easily find vulnerable package versions of Python/npm projects, and their closest fixed versions.

Note that the program works only with specific versions of packages - **if a package's version is not specified or it is ambiguous, it will be skipped and a warning will be displayed.**

# Usage
Use the `-r` option to pass a path (absolute or relative) to the requirements.txt file of a Python project:
```
./cve_hunter -r requirements.txt
```

OR

Use the `-p` option to pass a path (absolute or relative) to the package.json file of an npm project:
```
./cve_hunter -p package.json
```

You can also use the `-h` option to get help in the command line:
```
./cve_hunter -h
```

# Examples

Feel free to test the program with the dependencies/requirements files in `/examples`.

All of them are taken from real-world projects (and some are from trending github repositories).
